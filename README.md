# TETRIS CLONE
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/PucoVTtn_cY 
#### Description:
My CS50x Final Project is a Tetris clone implemented in Lua and the LÃ–VE2D library.

The development of this game allowed me to discover and collaborate on various critical programming concepts, including collision detection, handling game states, menu development, and incorporating sound.

This project also provided an excellent chance to implement what I had learned during the course and gain new first-hand knowledge in game development and logic design.
